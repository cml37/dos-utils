Procedure Purpose
================================================================

This procedure really serves two purposes:
 * Creating a "virtual" Packard Bell Legend 305CD (or basically any PB520R based Packard Bell)
 * Demonstrating how to do a system restore to a PB520R based Packard Bell when the original hard drive is not available
   * Packard bell puts System Credentials on the drive needed for the restore, sometimes called a "Tattoo"
     * This procedure helps with restoring that "Tattoo" to allow system restore to succeed
   
Now, if you are just trying to do a system restore on, say, a Packard Bell Legend 305CD with the original hard drive, the process is much easier
  * All you should need is the Packard Bell Multimedia Master CD and the Packard Bell Restore floppy disk image version 2.2 for MS-DOS
  * That said, if you have a replacement CD-ROM installed, this procedure may come in handy for "modifying the Packard Bell Restore floppy disk image

================================================================
Modify the Packard Bell Restore Floppy
================================================================

Use WinImage to extract cd1.sys from the DOS 6.22 Boot Disk

Use a program like WinZip or Universal Extractor to extract the Packard Bell Restore Floppy from the 142417.exe file that you downloaded earlier
  * The extracted file will be 142417.IMA

Use WinImage to modify the Packard Bell Restore Floppy
  * Delete det-cd.exe from the disk
  * Copy cd1.sys to the disk
    * image | inject... | cd1.sys | yes
  * Extract autoexec.bat from the disk
  * Make the following changes to autoexec.bat
    * Add rem in front of the A:\DET-CD.EXE line
      * REM A:\DET-CD.EXE
    * Add the following below that line
      * goto CR_IDE
    * Search for :CR_IDE and make the following changes underneath it
      * Change CR_ATAPI.SYS to CD1.sys
        * A:\DEVICE.COM A:\CD1.SYS /D:MSCD0001
    * Copy the modified autoexec.bat back to the disk
      * image | inject... | autoexec.bat | yes | yes to replace
  * Close WinImage and save the image


================================================================
Create a Disk to Support Restoring the System Credentials
================================================================

Open WinImage
 * Create a new 1.44MB floppy disk
   * File | New | 1.44MB
 * From the MBRTOOL.ZIP file, extract MBRTOOL.EXE
 * Copy MBRTOOL.EXE to the disk 
    * image | inject... | MBRTOOL.EXE | yes
 * Rename legend_305cd_pb520r_track_zero.128 to track0.128
 * Copy track0.128 to the disk
    * image | inject... | track0.128 | yes
 * Close WinImage and save the Image
    * File | Save | File Name: track0.img | Save as type: Image file (*.ima)


================================================================

Option 2: REAL SYSTEM RESTORE - Restored Image to CF Card
================================================================

DISCLAIMER: There may be a better way here, but this is what we have for now.  To be continued?

Create a BootIt Bare Metal Boot ISO using the makedisk.exe command associated with it
 * Unzip the BootIt Bare Metal Download
 * Click on makedisk.exe
 * Next
 * Select PC Platform (BIOS)
 * Next
 * Next
 * I accept the license agreement
 * Next
 * Uncheck "Image for DOS"
 * Next
 * Next
 * Next
 * Next
 * Next
 * Next
 * Next
 * Next
 * Next
 * Select ISO File
 * Put in a path and file name (i.e. D:\bootit.iso)
 * Finish
 * Close

 
Convert the PCem hard drive image to VHD: 
  * Launch a command prompt
  * Change to the VirtualBox directory (usually c:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox)
    * cd c:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox 
  * vboxmanage convertfromraw --format vhd <path to PCem image file> <path to new VirtualBox image file>
    * i.e vboxmanage convertfromraw --format vhd C:\Users\chris\Downloads\PCemV15Win\pb_hdd.img D:\pb.vhd

Insert and prepare the CF card
  * Use Disk Management to remove any old partitions off of the CF Card
    * Otherwise, the CF card will be locked by Windows
  * Once deleted, remove the CF card from the computer and reinsert it to clear any locking

Prepare the CF card to be mounted in VirtualBox
  * Start a command prompt with admin rights
    * wmic diskdrive list brief
      * identify your cf-cardâ€™s DeviceID (it should look something like \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE1)
    * Change to the VirtualBox directory (usually c:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox)
      * cd c:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox 
    * Type the following to create a raw virtual machine (.vmdk) (replace <path> with a good path and N in \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE1 with DeviceID)
      * vboxmanage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename <path>\CFCard.vmdk -rawdisk \\.\PhysicalDrive1
    * Exit the command prompt

Launch VirtualBox in Admin mode
  * Create a new virtual machine
    * New
      * Name: DOS
      * Next
      * Next
      * Do not add a virtual hard disk
      * Create
      * Continue
  * Edit the virtual machine
    * Click on the virtual machine in the list
    * Settings | Storage
    * Under Controller: IDE, click the CD-ROM
    * Attributes: Optical Drives => Click the CD ROM Icon | Choose Optical Virtual Disk File..
      * Select the BootIt Bare Metal ISO file that you made earlier
    * Click on Controller: IDE
      * Click on the "Hard Disk with a plus" ICON
        * Choose existing disk
        * Select your converted PCem hard drive (i.e. pb.vhd)
      * Click on the "Hard Disk with a plus" ICON
        * Choose existing disk
        * Select your CFCard.vmdk image
     * Click Ok to close settings

Use BootIt Bare Metal to copy the virtual hard disk partition to the CF card
  * Start the virtual machine
  * Choose "Cancel" from the BootIt setup screen
  * Click OK
  * Click Partition Work
  * Select "MBR 0" and click "Copy"
  * Using the "Drives" Dropdown, switch to your second drive (drive 1)
  * Click "Paste"
    * Name: MBR 0
    * Ok

Make the CF card bootable
  * Still on drive 1, View MBR
  * Set Active 
  * Apply

You can also use BootIt Bare Metal to expand the partition size on the CF card as needed
  * Still on drive 1, select Resize
  * Change the size accordingly!
    * Be careful, don't exceed 2048 MB or the drive won't boot!!

All set! You can now use the CF image in a real system!
  * On first boot, you might get a warning about a corrupt swap file, that's fine
  * I also suggest running C:\pbtools\backup\fixsys.bat since that is what gets run on first boot and detects hardware!
    * Not sure it is required, but couldn't hurt
