Wyse Vx0 Thin Client Windows 98 Second Edition Setup Procedures
--------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: This procedure has several specific requirements:
      * You will need an external USB CD-ROM Drive
      * You will need the ability to connect the thin client to
        a wired network
      * You will need the ability to share files from a file host
        that supports MS-DOS LAN Manager (SMB1)
        * See this procedure for details on how to configure a 
          Raspberry Pi to support SMB1: 
          https://github.com/cml37/dos-utils/blob/master/network/smb1_file_server/raspberrypi_pi_smb1_msdos_file_server.txt
      
NOTE: I recognize that there are a lot of prereqs here.  You can
      instead try to use a USB stick if you'd like, but this has
      worked with much mixed success on these machines.  
        * If you want to try it, instead of following the 
          "Partition and Format" section below, you can follow the
          "Partition and Format" portion of my HP T5700 procedure
          * Link: https://github.com/cml37/dos-utils/blob/master/config/hp_t5700_win98se.txt
