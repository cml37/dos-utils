Download arch Linux from https://www.archlinux32.org/download/ (I downloaded archlinux32-2024.07.10-i686.iso)
Burn it to a DVD

Using my boot manager BootIt Bare Metal, I created three partitions:
* Boot - 1GB - 131: Linux Native
* Root - 12GB - 131: Linux Native
* Swap - 8GB  - 130: Linux Swap/Solaris


From there, I loosely followed this guide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide

# Check network connectivity and set the clock
ip link
timedatectl

# Create ext4 partitions for boot and root
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2

# Configure Swap 
mkswap /dev/sda3
swapon /dev/sda3

# Mount root partition and bootstrap Linux install!
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
pacstrap -K /mnt base Linux Linux-firmware

# Create an fstab, and change root to use your bootstrapped Linux
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
arch-chroot /mnt

# Set your localtime, for me it is America/New_York.  And sync the clock
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc

# Populate keys for pacman and install vi editor
pacman-key --populate
pacman -S vi

# Set the locale 
vi /etc/locale.conf
LANG=en_US.UTF-8

# Set the hostname, I set mine to "obsolete"
vi /etc/hostname
obsolete

# Create a new initramfs, though I hear it is not required
mkinitcpio -P

# Move boot files from the root partition to the boot partition
# (There is probably a better way to do this, but it works)
mkdir /boot2
mv /boot/* /boot2
mount /dev/sda1 /boot
mv /boot2/* /boot
rmdir boot2

# Add the boot partition to /etc/fstab
vi /etc/fstab
/dev/sda1	/boot	ext4	rw,relatime	0 1

# Set the root password to one of your choosing
passwd


Now it is time to install grub. I loosely followed this guide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB#Configuration
NOTE: We're installing grub to the /boot partition as opposed to the master boot record, etc., since I use BootIt Bare Metal and I have multiple OSes on my system

# Install and configure grub
pacman -S grub
grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda1 --force
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

# Leave chroot that we entered several steps ago and reboot
exit 
reboot


Now it is time to configure network and install the X server, and create a user!

# After reboot, enable network and name resolution
systemctl enable systemd-networkd
systemctl enable systemd-resolved

# Add configuration for your network card.  When I do an "ip link", mine shows up as enp0s14, so I configure accordingly
vi /etc/systemd/network/1-enp0s14.network

[Match]
Name=enp0s14

[Network]
DHCP=ipv4


# Enable network and name resolution
systemctl start systemd-networkd
systemctl start systemd-resolved

# Check the status of networkd, make sure you can ping sites!
ping google.com

# Install the X Server
# Depending on your video hardware, you can choose different drivers, we will just use Frame Buffer drivers
sudo pacman -S xorg xorg-server xf86-video-fbdev
(Select the first provider for man when asked)

# Create a user and add them to the wheel group, my user is chris
useradd -mG wheel chris
passwd chris


Now let's install Xfce, I loosely followed this guide, and embellished a bit: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xfce

# Install xfce, some goodies, a web browser, some apps, and the lxdm greeter
pacman -S xfce4 xfce4-goodies dillo kwrite kcalc lxdm

# Enable the lxdm greeter and enter graphical mode
systemctl enable --now lxdm 


Now let's configure sound!  I loosely followed these guides :
* https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture
* https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PulseAudio

# Install alsa, and PulseAudio too
pacman -S alsa-utils xfce4-mixer pavucontrol pulseaudio mpv

# Now you should really check out the mpv audio/video player, pretty cool stuff!


Now let's configure Samba network access 

# Add WINS resolution to the types of name resolutions
vi /etc/nsswitch.conf
hosts: .... dns wins

# Install gvfs, samba, and required libraries
pacman -S gvfs-smb samba icu74

# Reboot for good measure
reboot

When the system comes back up, you should be able to use the file browser to access Windows shares by using the format smb://server/share

That's all for now!
