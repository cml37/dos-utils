Download Rufus: https://sourceforge.net/projects/rufus.mirror/

Insert your USB stick into your computer

Launch Rufus:
-- Boot selection: FreeDOS
-- Start
-- Ok
-- Close

Copy xxcopy16 to the root of the USB drive
-- Download https://web.archive.org/web/20210729154903/http://www.xxcopy.com/download/xxcopy16.zip
-- unzip and put xxcopy16.exe in the root of the USB drive

Copy Windows 98 USB drivers to the root of the USB drive
-- Download https://www.philscomputerlab.com/uploads/3/7/2/3/37231621/nusb36e.exe
-- Put in the root of the USB drive

Copy all of your driver goodies into a subfolder on the USB stick called "drivers"
NOTE: We will copy these drivers over to the thin client after we install Windows 98 and have installed Windows 98 USB drivers

* Network driver (VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6102/VT6103 [Rhine-II]): https://www.philscomputerlab.com/uploads/3/7/2/3/37231621/via_rhine_ndis5_v384a.zip
  -- suggest unzipping this in the install directory on the USB stick
  -- you only really need the X86 directory out of this
* Video

Copy your Windows 98 SE installer to a directory called "install" on the USB stick

  -- Once copied, rename it to "install"

Insert the USB stick into the thin client
Boot with your image

When booted, copy the installer files to the hard disk
  mkdir D:\install
  xxcopy16 install /s D:\install

Also, copy the Windows 98 USB drivers to the root of the hard disk
copy nusb36e.exe D:\

Take the USB stick out and reboot!!
