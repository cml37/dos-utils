====================================
Installations
====================================
Install Oracle VM VirtualBox
Install WinImage

====================================
Create and Configure Virtual Machine
====================================
Create an OS/2 virtual machine in VirtualBox
New
Name: OS/2
Memory size: 32MB
Hard Disk: Create a virtual hard disk now
Hard disk file type: VMDK (this is important so that WinImage can open your hard disk file!!)
Storage on physical hard disk: Dynamically allocated
File location and size: 
  default location is fine
  for size, make it around 250 MB (definitely no bigger than 512MB)

Once created
 Settings
 Network
 Adapter 1
   Enable Network Adapter
   Attached to: Bridged Adapter
   Name: (choose your "real" network adapter... wireless is fine)
 Settings
 Storage
 Controller: IDE
  Remove the CD ROM Drive
 
====================================
Launch Virtual Machine and Install OS/2
====================================
Insert Microsoft OS/2 1.30.1 "Install A" floppy disk into the virtual floppy drive
Click start on the virtual machine

After system boots:
  Press Enter 4 times!
  Accept Predefined Primary Partition
  Send a Virtual CTRL+ALT+DELETE (Host + r)
  
System will Reboot
  When prompted, insert disk 1 and press Enter
  Choose FAT for the file system
  Accept Predefined System Configuration
  Yes to confirm display adapter of VGA
  Change mouse to Microsoft Mouse, PS/2 Version
  Accept Configuration
  When prompted, insert disk 2 and press Enter
  When prompted, insert disk 3 and press Enter
  When prompted, insert disk 4 and press Enter
  When prompted, insert disk 5 and press Enter
  When prompted, insert disk "Install B" and press Enter
  When prompted, insert disk "Install A" and press Enter
  When prompted, insert disk "Support" and press Enter
  When prompted, insert disk Presentation Manager Device "Driver 1" and press Enter
  Choose "Do not install a default printer"
  Choose "no" when asked about having a Device Support Disk
  Eject the floppy disk from the virtual drive and do a Host + r to reboot
    
====================================
Install Microsoft LAN Manager
====================================
First, use WinImage to take the AMD PCNET drivers for VirtualBox and make a disk
  Unzip the drivers to a folder
  Launch WinImage
    File -> New -> 1.44MB 
    Image -> Inject a Folder -> Select your unzipped drivers folder -> Yes
    File -> Save As -> change type to Image file *.ima -> name: pcnet.ima
  Exit WinImage
  
Now, install LAN Manager
  Insert the LAN Manager "Setup" disk into the drive
  Launch an OS/2 Window
  A:
  setup
  Ok
  Ok
  Ok (default locations are fine)
  When prompted, insert "Workstation 1" disk and press Enter
  When prompted, insert "Workstation 2" disk and press Enter
  When prompted for a driver, choose "Other Driver" and press enter
  When prompted, insert the pcnet.ima disk into the virtual drive and press enter
  Choose the one and only driver choice for the "PCNet Family" and press enter
  Select MS TCP/IP and Netbeui and press enter
  Select Ok and press enter
  IP address: choose a static IP address on your network
  Netmask: Set this for your network (usually 255.255.255.0)
  Press enter
  Computername: your choice
  Domain: WORKGROUP (or your workgroup)
  Ok
  Save
  When prompted, insert "Workstation 2" disk and press Enter
  When prompted, insert "Drivers" disk and press Enter
  Ok
  Remove virtual disk from the drive
 Desktop Manager -> Desktop -> Shutdown -> Shutdown
 Reboot (Host + r)
  
Test LAN Manager install
  After reboot, an OS/2 window for STARTUP.CMD will appear
  Press Enter for username and password
  Type "net use Z: \\computer\share" (using of course your computer name and share, I find that Raspberry PIs work great here)
  Change to drive Z: and do a dir

====================================
IBM TCP/IP for OS/2 1.3.1
====================================
NOTE: LAN Manager and IBM TCP/IP for OS/2 do not play well together, despite conventional wisdom (your mileage may vary).  This procedure takes that into account.

Prepare and kick off installation for IBM TCP/IP for OS/2
  Insert Disk 1 into the drive
  md C:\tcpinst
  A:
  copy *.* C:\tcpinst
  C:
  cd tcpinst
  tcpinst

The installation will now proceed
  Ok
  Ok to select default paths
  Ok to start installing files
  When prompted, insert disk 2 and press Enter
  When prompted, insert disk 3 and press Enter
  When prompted, insert disk 4 and press Enter
  When prompted for addresses
    Host: Any name is fine
    Domain: I just use WORKGROUP
    ND0: 
      IP Address: Choose the same IP address that you chose for LAN Manager above
    For the rest, defaults are fine
    Ok
  For each dialog that follows asking for configuration, just accept defaults:
    Miscellaneous Applications
     Ok
    Server Programs
     Ok
    NetBIOS
     Ok
    InterDrive
     Ok
    Vmail
     Ok
    Sendmail
     Ok
     No    
    Kernel
     Ok
    Kerberos
     Ok
    Bind
     Ok
    Configure PC/TCP DOS/Windows Applications
     Ok
  The installation is complete
    Save
    Ok
    Ok when notified to reboot
    Eject the virtual floppy from the drive
    
Now we need to make a few changes
  cd \ to go back to root of C:
  Launch the editor and edit startup.cmd
    e startup.cmd
      remove the netbind and tcpmgr start lines
      File -> Save
        Click type
        Choose Plain text
        Set
      File -> new
        Add two lines
          net stop workstation /y
          tcpmgr start
      File -> Save
        File name: starttcp.cmd
        Ok

Add support for TCP to the LAN Manager protocol.ini file
  e C:\lanman\protocol.ini
    Add this new section
    
    [SOCKET]
    DRIVERNAME = $SOCKET
    BINDINGS = "PCNTND_NIF"

    File -> Save
      Click type
      Choose Plain text
      Set

At this point, reboot the system 
  Desktop Manager -> Desktop -> Shutdown -> Shutdown
  Host + r          
  
After reboot, press enter twice to put in the default username and password for LAN Manager          
          
Now if you want to use TCP/IP:
  Launch an OS/2 window
    starttcp
  From there you can use telnet, tracerou, or any other utility under C:\pctcp\bin
 
If you want to go back to using LAN Manager again, it will require a reboot
  What I have found is that after the ifconfig command is launched, there is "no turning back"
    It is launched via tcpmgr start, which calls C:\pctcp\bin\pctcp.cmd
  Perhaps if there is a way to unload the driver, you could call a "net start workstation" later, but my attempts have been unsuccessful
