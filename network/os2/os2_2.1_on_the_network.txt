Items to Locate
====================================
Oracle VM VirtualBox 
 * If you want working sound: ideally use 5.1.38, but Windows 10 is NOT going to let you install that
   * https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.1.38/VirtualBox-5.1.38-122592-Win.exe
 * As such, I suggest version 6.0.18 or lower to avoid virtualization issues that could result in "trap" errors
   * https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.0.18/VirtualBox-6.0.18-136238-Win.exe
