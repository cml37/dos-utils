Accessing and Using the Facebook Messenger Bridge Server Via IRCJr
====================================================================
Download mTCP: http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/

Follow my mTCP Setup guide: https://github.com/cml37/dos-utils/blob/master/network/mtcp/target_system/mtcp.txt
(you don't need to create batch files for telnet or ftp)
Edit tcp.cfg and add some IRCJR specific parameters:
 IRCJR_NICK <nickname>
 IRCJR_USER <any old username>
 IRCJR_NAME <any old name>

Launch IRCJr, passing in your virtual host name
  Example: 
    cd \mtcp
    config.bat 
    ircjr raspberrypi

You'll now be connected to BitlBee.  Add an account for you and associate the Facebook Messenger user with your account.
  register
  /oper <nickname> <your_password>
  account add facebook <email> <password>
  account on

At this point you may have to go to Facebook's home page, login, and verify the account
  Go to facebook.com
  Log In
  Login Approval Needed -> Continue
  Choose an option -> Your choice -> Continue
  Proceed through the prompts to confirm

You can now join an existing chat, groupchat, etc.  Directions are here! https://wiki.bitlbee.org/HowtoFacebookMQTT

We will go ahead and have an individual chat with a friend
  /msg send FriendName Hello!
  This will open a new window and you can chat as you normally would!
  Alternatively if a friend starts a chat with you, that will pop up in a new window!

If you want to go back to the main window with contacts:
  ALT+1
  From there you can pick another person for chatting

To exit IRCjr
  ALT+X

Want to log in later?
  cd \mtcp
  config.bat
  ircjr raspberrypi
  identify
  /oper <nickname> <your_password>
