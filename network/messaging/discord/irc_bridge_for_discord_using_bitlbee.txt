====================================================================
Preconditions
====================================================================
You have set up a Raspberry Pi and enabled SSH.
  See my instructions here for an example: https://github.com/cml37/dos-utils/blob/master/config/my_raspberrypi_setup_instructions.txt
  For purposes of this procedure, we will be using the hostname "raspberrypi"

You have a proceess for getting files from your modern computer to your old computer
  Zip drive, floppy drive, network, CD burner, etc.

====================================================================
Installing the Discord Bridge Using BitlBee
====================================================================

SSH to your raspberry pi using your favorite SSH program
  We'll demo this procedure using Putty for windows
  Host Name: raspberrypi
  Username: pi
  Password: <password you chose during the Raspberry Pi installation procedure>

Install BitlBee
  sudo apt-get install bitlbee-dev autoconf libtool libglib2.0-dev

Install the BitlBee Discord Plugin
  git clone https://github.com/sm00th/bitlbee-discord.git
  cd bitlbee-discord
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

Start BitlBee
  sudo /etc/init.d/bitlbee restart
  If you want bitlbee to start on system reboot you can add the above "restart line to /etc/rc.local as well


====================================================================
Accessing and Using the Discord Bridge Server Via IRCJr
====================================================================
Download mTCP: http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/

Follow my mTCP Setup guide: https://github.com/cml37/dos-utils/blob/master/network/mtcp/target_system/mtcp.txt
(you don't need to create batch files for telnet or ftp)
Edit tcp.cfg and add some IRCJR specific parameters:
 IRCJR_NICK <nickname>
 IRCJR_USER <any old username>
 IRCJR_NAME <any old name>
 IRCJR_BACKSCROLL 375

Launch IRCJr, passing in your virtual host name
  Example: 
    cd \mtcp
    config.bat 
    ircjr raspberrypi

You'll now be connected to BitlBee.  Add an account for you and associate the Discord user with your account.
  register
  /oper <nickname> <your_password>
  account add discord <your discord account> <your password>
  account on

From there you can join discord channels
  chat list discord
  Use pgup to scroll through history (if you have too many channels and "not enough history", see next step)
  find the channel number to join
  chat add discord !<channel number> #anynameyoulike
  /join #naynameyoulike

If you have too many channels, you might need to find an alternate IRC client to see the full list of channels
You can use irssi on the Raspberry Pi command line!  Here's how:
  sudo apt install irssi
  cd ~/.irssi
  irssi
  /quit
  nano ~/.irssi/config
  <look for "settings">
  <Change this line to match what you used for the IRCJR settings above>
  core = { real_name = "<whatever you used for IRCJR_NAME above>"; user_name = "<whatever you used for IRCJR_USER above "; nick = "<whatever you used for IRCJR_NICK above"; };
  CTRL+X then y to save
  irssi
  <BEFORE YOU PROCEED WITH THE NEXT COMMAND, MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE EXITED IRCJR>
  /connect raspberrypi
  join &bitlbee
  /oper <nickname> <your_password>
  chat list discord
  <Use pgup to scroll through history and find your channel number>
  chat add discord !<channel number> #anynameyoulike
  /quit

If you want to return to IRCjr at a future point:
  cd \mtcp
  config.bat
  ircjr raspberrypi
  identify
  /oper <nickname> <your_password>
  <All set! Of course, some time has passed and maybe you forgot your channel names.  No problem!>
  channel list
  <Ah I see my channel, now I want to join it>
  /join #mychannelname

Have fun!  And, oh, want to do something more fancy?  Check out some of the other settings:
