Download the following files:
* DOS 6.22 Boot ISO: https://www.allbootdisks.com/downloads/ISO/AllBootDisks_ISO_Image_Downloads25/DOS6.22_bootdisk.iso

Create a new VirtualBox VM
  New
  Name: DOS Server
  Type: Other
  Version: DOS
  Memory size: 32MB
  Hard Disk: Create a virtual hard disk now
  Hard Disk file type: VMDK
  Storage on physical hard disk: Dynamically allocated
  File location and size: defaults are fine

Once created
 Settings
 Network
 Adapter 1
   Enable Network Adapter
   Attached to: Bridged Adapter
   Name: Choose your active network card


====================================================================
Configure MS-DOS File Sharing Server
====================================================================
Start the new VM
Insert the DOS 6.22 ISO into the drive
Use FDISK to set up the partition
  fdisk
  1 to create DOS partition
  1 to create primary DOS partition
  Y for max size and making active
  Any key to reboot

format C: /s
y to confirm
ENTER when asked about volume label

Eject the DOS 6.22 ISO from the drive

Reboot the virtual machine

Prepare installlation of MS Client
  Insert the msclient.ima disk that you created above into the floppy drive

  mkdir C:\install
  copy A:\*.* C:\install

  Insert the patch.ima that you created above into the floppy drive
  copy A:\*.* C:\install

  Eject the patch.ima floppy disk image from the drive
  Insert the DOS 6.22 ISO into the drive

Copy over share.exe, the AMD PCnet III drivers, remove unneeded drivers, and copy over the Network Server Patch
  copy A:\share.exe C:\
  copy C:\install\pcntnd.dos C:\net
  copy C:\install\wg1049.exe C:\net
  del C:\net\am2100.dos

  C:
  cd net
  wg1049
  (press "a" to overwrite all files)

Configure MS Client for network sharing and for the AMD PCNET III drivers

  A:\edit C:\net\system.ini
    Under [network], edit these line to read as follows:
      filesharing=yes
      printsharing=yes

    Under [network], edit the autostart line to read as follows:
      autostart=basic,server
  
    Under [network_drivers], do the following:
      Change netcard to read as follows
        netcard=pcntnd.dos
      Delete the line am2100.dos=LOW
   
    Save and exit
   
   A:\edit C:\net\protocol.ini
     Under [network.setup], edit the following lines to read as follows:
       netcard=ms$pcntnd,1
       lana0=ms$pcntnd,1,tcpip

     Under [tcpip], edit the following lines to read as follows:
       BINDINGS=MS$PCNTND

     Find this heading and change it accordingly:
      [MS$AM2100] => [MS$PCNTND]

     Under [MS$PCNTND] section do the following
       REMOVE ALL EXISTING LINES
       Add one new line:
         DriverName=PCNTND$

     Save and exit

Upon boot completion, you can now share a drive!  
  For example, to share drive C: as \\DOS\drivec and give full access:
    net share drivec=C:\ /FULL
    
The drive is immediately available for access from any system that supports SMB1
  Note: Modern windows does not support SMB1 by default
  
Additionally, on future boots, the drive should be shared and available!! 
  To delete this share, you would type the following:
    net share drivec /d
