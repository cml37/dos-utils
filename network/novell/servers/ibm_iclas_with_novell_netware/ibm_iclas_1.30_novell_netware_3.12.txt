=====================================================================
Items to Locate
=====================================================================
Locate your licensed copy of Novell Netware 3.12 (3.5" disks)
-- This should contain NetView Netware Management (sometimes called "NetWare Management Agent") and BASICMHS
-- You will also need the following Novell patches
   -- 312ptd
   -- odi33g
   -- 312y2kp2
   -- lib312c
Locate your licensed copy of IBM Classroom LAN Administration System 1.x (This procedure tested with version 1.30)
-- You will also need a patched copy of disk 4 which fixes a bug with the "CLSCLASS" program used to add/remove classrooms
-- For licensed users, an archival "IBM Classroom LAN Administration System 1.30 Disk 4 Patch" version looks to be available on Vetusware
Locate your licensed copy of PC DOS 6.3

Obtain drivers:
  AMD PCNet NetWare 3.12 Server drivers (odi_ahsm_svr3x.zip): https://github.com/cml37/dos-utils/blob/master/config/resources/odi_ahsm_svr3x.zip
  -- unzip to folder named odi_ahsm_svr3x

Insert Disk 1 of IBM ICLAS into drive A:
A:g
Press any key
Press esc when asked to insert a DOS disk
Cycle through disks
  After inserting each disk, continually press the spacebar key until prompted for next disk
  This is required due to the way that the "flag" command works during the install, and it basically waits for user input
  ALSO ==> !!!!!!BE SURE TO USED THE PATCHED VERSION OF DISK 4!!!!!!
 
When done, on server:
  ALT + ESC to get back to the main console if needed
  down 
  exit 
  server

Remove floppy disk from drive
Reboot client

Copy over DOS files used by ICLAS
  F:\
  login supervisor
