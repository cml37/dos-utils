Items to Locate
=====================================================================
Locate your licensed copy of Novell Personal NetWare 1.0 (1993) (3.5-1.44mb)

Obtain drivers:
  AMD PCNet network card client drivers (lan-amd-pc-net.zip): https://github.com/cml37/dos-utils/blob/master/config/resources/lan-amd-pc-net.zip
  -- unzip to folder named lan
  AMD PCNet client32 drivers (client32-Novell-Drivers.zip) (we will only need this for an updated version of lsl.com): https://github.com/cml37/dos-utils/blob/master/config/resources/client32-Novell-Drivers.zip
  -- unzip to folder named client32

Download Oracle VM VirtualBox (suggested version 6.0.18 or lower) https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.0.18/VirtualBox-6.0.18-136238-Win.exe  
   * When you create your VM, if you get a "VERR_SUPDRV_NO_RAW_MODE_HYPERV_V_ROOT" error on launch, 
     you might need to run through this procedure: https://appuals.com/raw-mode-is-unavailable-hyper-v/
Download WinImage
Download MS-DOS 6.22 Boot ISO: https://www.allbootdisks.com/disk_images/DOS6.22_bootdisk.iso


====================================
Installations
====================================
Install Oracle VM VirtualBox
Install WinImage

  
=====================================================================
Set Up The "Base Image" to be used for Personal NetWare
=====================================================================
Create a new VirtualBox VM
  New
  Name: Personal NetWare DOS
  Type: Other
  Version: DOS
  Memory size: 16MB
  Hard Disk: Create a virtual hard disk now
  Hard disk file type: VMDK (this is important so that WinImage can open your hard disk file!!)
  Storage on physical hard disk: Dynamically allocated
  File location and size: defaults are fine

Once created
 Settings
 Network
 Adapter 1
   Enable Network Adapter
   Attached to: Bridged Adapter
   Name: (if planning to host "real" machines, choose your wired network adapter... wireless will NOT work.  Otherwise, wireless is fine)


Start the new VM
Insert the DOS 6.22 ISO into the drive
Use FDISK to set up the partition
  fdisk
  1 to create DOS partition
  1 to create primary DOS partition
  Y for max size and making active
  Any key to reboot

format C: /s
y to confirm
ENTER when asked about volume label

mkdir C:\msdos
copy *.* C:\msdos

Create a config.sys file that optimizes memory
  edit C:\config.sys
    DEVICE=C:\MSDOS\HIMEM.SYS /TESTMEM:OFF
    DEVICEHIGH=C:\MSDOS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS
    DOS=HIGH,UMB
    
Create an autoexec.bat with a DOS path statement
  edit C:\autoexec.bat
    PATH=C:\MSDOS

Eject the DOS 6.22 ISO from the drive

Power down the virtual machine

At this point, it's time to inject some files into the image
Using WinImage
  -- Open the vmdk file (C:\users\<your user name\VirtualBox VMS\Personal NetWare DOS.vmdk)
  -- From lan\netware\dos, inject pcntnw.com and pcntnw.ins into a directory named net
    -- Click on \ folder
    -- Image | Create Folder | net
    -- Click on net
    -- Image | Inject | pcntnw.com | Yes
    -- Image | Inject | pcntnw.ins | Yes
  -- from client32, inject lsl.com into a directory named nwclient
    -- Click on \ folder
    -- Image | Create Folder | nwclient
    -- Click on nwclient
    -- Image | Inject | lsl.com | Yes
    
Close WinImage


=====================================================================
Set up Additional "Base" Personal NetWare Machines
=====================================================================
Decide how many clients you would like to have

Just 1? You are done, proceed to next section
More than 1?  Create some clones! 
  Right Click on Personal NetWare DOS in VirtualBox
  Select "Clone"
  Create a new name to your liking
  Next
  Clone


=====================================================================
Configure All Personal NetWare Machines
=====================================================================
Repeat this process for the base machine and all clones created above, but keep the following in mind:
* Choose different installation serial numbers
* Choose different usernames

    
Insert Personal NetWare Disk 1 into the Floppy Drive

A:
install
Continue with installation

Name: Your Name
Company: Anything You'd Like
Serial Number: <some unique number, each machine and clone needs its own number>
Accept the above and continue
Continue

Primary Network Interface Card: OEM Supplied Driver
Source path for driver file(s): C:\net
Accept the above and continue

Share this computer's resources: 
  Your choice
    * more resident memory usage if you check the box, but more capability.  
    * At least one machine must have this enabled for sharing!!
    * If setting up first machine, enable this!
User of this computer: <something unique, each machine should be different>

Select server types to connect to: 
  Your choice, but at least have Personal NetWare Desktop Servers or the "net" program does not get installed 
  More options = more resident memory used
Accept the above and continue

Optimize/Network Management
  Unchecking items here (except DPMS) will save resident memory if that is a concern, especially the cache
  None of these items are required, so you can uncheck them all
Accept the above and continue

Accept the above and continue (no need to configure the primary interface card)
Start Installation

Insert disks as prompted
When prompted to overwrite lsl.com, CHOOSE NO!!!

Installation is Complete
Press Enter

Accept the Above and Continue (third party driver screen)
Restart Operating System
(remove the floppy disk from the drive, then press enter)


After Restart:
Continue With First Time Setup (IF THIS IS NOT THE FIRST MACHINE YOU ARE SETTING UP, MAKE SURE THE FIRST MACHINE IS UP AND RUNNING!)

If this is the first machine you are setting up
  Specify a Workgroup Name, your choice
  Accept the above and continue
  For the drive/port share page, select Accept the above and continue (you can uncheck the LPT1 port if you don't want to share it)
  Save Changes and Exit
  Enter
  Enter
      
If this is not the first machine you are setting up
  Join Selected Workgroup (the workgroup will be the one you set up on the first machine)
  For the drive/port share page, select Accept the above and continue (you can uncheck the LPT1 port if you don't want to share it)
  Save Changes and Exit
  Enter
  Enter
   
Now, if you don't want to type your username every time you boot:
  edit C:\nwclient\startnet.bat
  Add your username to end of the "net login" line of the file, i.e.
    C:\NWCLIENT\NET LOGIN YOURUSER  

But if you don't do this, or if you forgot your username, it should be the server name minus the extension, which is shown on boot up!
    Example: in the output prior to login prompt, I see NWUSER_PC, so my username is NWUSER
  
Great!  Want to see what the state of the world is?
  net
    here you can map drivers and printers
    when done, you can choose File | Save Script and your settings will be preserved for future logins!
    Want to see non Personal NetWare Servers? go to View | Include and check "Bindery Servers" and "Directory Services Tree"
      ^^ I have NO IDEA why this isn't the default...
