Install File and Print Services for NetWare
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Insert the Microsoft Directory Service Manager for NetWare(R) 3.51 disc into the CD ROM drive

Click Start and select Settings, then Control Panel. Double-click the Network icon.
Select the Services tab, and then click the Add button.
In the box under "Network Service:", select Have Disk...
  D:\FPNW\NT40\i386
  Click OK.
  Select "File and Print Services for NetWare.
  Click OK.
  Make a note of the server name, you can change it if you like.
  Click OK.
  Click OK (no password).
  Click Yes.
  Click Close.
  Click Yes to restart.


At this point, once the NT server finishes restarting, you can connect up a NetWare client and login as supervisor!!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Optional) Configure and Share a Network Printer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, you need to have Microsoft TCP/IP Printing Service installed. To install it, follow the steps below:
  Click Start and select Settings, then Control Panel. Double-click the Network icon.
  Select the Services tab, and then click the Add button.
  In the box under "Network Service:", select Microsoft TCP/IP Printing.
  Insert the NT Server ISO into the Optical Drive
  Click Continue.
  Click Close.
  Click Yes to restart.

You also need to set up a printer port, as described below:
  Click Start and select Settings, then Printers.
  Double-click the Add Printer icon.
  Select My computer, and then click Next.
  Select Add Port to display the available port types. Choose LPR Port and click New Port..
  In the dialog box, enter the IP address for the printer.
  Click Ok.
  Click Close.
  The port should now be selected for your printer.  Click Next.
  Select the LPR/LPD port with the printer IP address you just added.

From this point, you will continue with the Add Printer Wizard. 
You'll want to choose a printer that will be compatible with your networked printer.  
For laser printers, the HP LaserJet 4 is a good choice. But be warned that this could be a "trial and error" procedure for your printer!
  Insert the NT Server ISO into the Optical Drive
  Highlight the manufacturer on the left, highlight the printer on the right, and click Next.
  Give your printer a name. Then click Next.
  Choose to share the printer with other users. Then click Next.
  Choose whether or not you want to print a test page and click Finish.
  Remove the NT Server ISO from the Optical Drive
  
Change all default printing to be raw
  I've noticed that the default print method from the Windows NT version of capture.exe is TEXT, which cause problems if you want to print graphics
  Here's how to fix that
  Start | run | regedit <enter>
  Navigate to  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\FPNW\Parameters
  Right click on the panel and the right and choose New -> String Value
  Name it DefaultTextDatatype
  Then double click on it and set its value: RAW
  OK
  Close Registry Editor

Change the internal network number to be nonzero (otherwise, some NetWare clients won't connect!)
  Settings | Control Panel | Network | Protocols
  Double click on NWLink IPX/SXP Properties
  Internal Network Number: 00000123
  OK
  Reboot!
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Optional) Connecting the NetWare Client to the Printer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Login as SUPERVISOR
capture Q=hp_laserjet_4 (or whatever the NAME of your printer is, with underscores)

All set!  Now you can print.  Want to test it?
  echo hi > lpt1
  (you should get a printout!)
