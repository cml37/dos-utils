Configuring XFS
------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: This procedure will not work on 8088 systems (a NEC V20 or higher is required)

Obtain the XFS 1.91 DOS client: 
http://omolini.steptail.com/mirror/winsite/winsite-mar96-3/info/pc/win3/winsock/xfs191.zip/index.html
Unzip the above contents to a directory called xfs

Locate a packet driver for your network card
Copy the packet driver to the xfs directory
Using AMD PCNET III packet drivers with VirtualBox?
  * You can find packet drivers here: https://www.lazybrowndog.net/freedos/virtualbox/downloads/drivers/pcntpk.zip

If you want to run on a newer system (i.e on a VM or a system > 200 Mhz), you need to patch C:\xfs\xfstool.exe
  Download and extract this utility
   https://www.kennedysoftware.ie/patchcrt.htm
  Copy it to the xfs directory
  (We'll proceed to patch this here in just a few minutes)


In the xfs directory, modify the "hosts" file
 * Set the gateway, broadcast and netmask addresses to those of your network
 * Add an IP address and alias for the OpenMediaVault server (you can find this by doing a "ping openmediavault" from your modern computer)
 * Add an IP address and alias for your client computer (just pick a new address on your network)
 
 Example Config file (be sure to replace with settings from your configuration!!):
  
 192.168.1.1     gateway
 192.168.1.255   broadcast
 255.255.255.0   netmask
 
 192.168.1.140   openmediavault
 192.168.1.111   client

In the xfs directory, modify the "init" file
  * modify the init line to initialize the client using the netmask and gateway from above, i.e.
      init client sm=255.255.255.0 gw=192.168.1.1 csum=off
  * remove the "pcnfsd" line 
  * remove the "login" line
  * modify the drive letter "mount" lines to mount a share, specifying a drive letter, the "server" name, 
    and the full path on the server of the share, keeping in mind that OpenMediaVault shares start with /export by default 
      mount E: openmediavault:/export/test
    (NOTE: if you want to user a drive letter that is further in the alphabet, add LASTDRIVE=Z to your config.sys)
  * remove the printer "mount" lines
      mount lpt2 nfspi:test
  * remove the rdate line
    
  Here's my complete init file:  
    init client sm=255.255.255.0 gw=192.168.1.1 csum=off
    mount E: openmediavault:/export/test
    show

In the xfs directory, modify xfs.bat
 * The first line should reference your packet driver, along with a command to initialize the packet vector to 0x60 (this command will vary by manufacturer)
 * The next line should be xfskrnl 0x60
 * And the last line should be xfstool @init (this references and executes the file you created in the previous step
 
 Here's my complete xfs.bat file
  pcntpk INT=0x60
  xfskrnl 0x60
  xfstool @init

Copy the xfs directory to your retro PC or to a virtual machine instance

If you are running on a newer system (i.e on a VM or a system > 200 Mhz), you need to patch C:\xfs\xfstool.exe
  In the xfs directory, run the utility:
    patchcrt
    (press escape)
    C:\xfs\xfstool.exe
    Y to indicate you have a good backup
    (press escape)
  
Run and connect!
  cd xfs
  xfs.bat  
  
If you want to mount a new directory, or execute a command to "show connections", you can do this from the command line, i.e.:
  * xfstool mount Q: openmediavault:/some/other/path
  * xfstool show

If you want to make a new directory permanent, add it to the C:\xfs\init file without the "xsftool" portion of the command 
  * See configuration performed in an above step for examples
