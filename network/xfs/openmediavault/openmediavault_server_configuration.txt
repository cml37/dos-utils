====================================================================
Preconditions
====================================================================
You have Oracle VM VirtualBox installed on your host system
   * When you create your VM, if you get a "VERR_SUPDRV_NO_RAW_MODE_HYPERV_V_ROOT" error on launch, 
     you might need to run through this procedure: https://appuals.com/raw-mode-is-unavailable-hyper-v/

Installing OpenMediaVault
====================================================================
Download OpenMediaVault
  Navigate to https://www.openmediavault.org/
  Download Stable ISO

Create a VM for OpenMediaVault (skip this section if you are installing on real hardware)
  Launch Oracle VM VirtualBox
  New
  Name: OpenMediaVault
  Type: Linux
  Version: Other Linux (64-bit)
  Next
  Memory Size: 1024 MB
  Next
  Create a virtual hard disk now
  Create
  VMDK (Virtual Machine Disk)
  Next
  Dynamically Allocated
  Next
  Create (defaults are fine)

  Select your OpenMediaVault virtual machine
  Settings
  Network
  Attached to: Bridged Adapter
  Name: <Choose your network card>
  Storage
  Click the Hard Disk Icon with a green plus
  Create New Disk
  VMDK
  Next
  Dynamically Allocated
  Next
  (since this will be your file storage disk, change the size to something that suits you)
  Create
  Select the "Empty" optical disc
  Click on the icon to the right of the optical drive
  Choose virtual optical file
  <select your OpenMediaVault ISO image>
  Open
  Ok

Install OpenMediaVault
  Select your OpenMediaVault virtual machine
  Start
  Enter to Install
  Enter on English <or choose another language if desired>
  Enter on United States <or choose another country if desired>
  Enter on American English keymap <or choose another keymap if desired>
  Some time later, Enter on hostname 
  Enter on domain name
  Choose a root password, be sure to remember it, then press enter.  Enter it again to verify, then press enter
  Choose your timezone and press enter
  Continue on "more than one storage device has been detected"
  Enter to partition first disk
  Enter on Configure the package manager <or choose a country closer to you>
  Enter on second screen for Configure the package manager
  Enter on configuring a proxy
  Enter to finish the installation

At this point the system will reboot and you can log in to OpenMedia Vault
  Username: root
  Password: <your password>

Perform some steps to make OpenMediaVault compatible with NFS 2.0

  nano /srv/salt/omv/deploy/nfs/files/etc-default-nfs-kernel-server.j2
   add quotes around {{ rpc_nfsd_count }} like you see on the next line:
     RPCNFSDCOUNT="{{ rpc_nfsd_count }}"
   CTRL-X, y, ENTER to save the file
  
  nano /etc/default/openmediavault
   add this line:
     OMV_NFSD_COUNT="8 -V 2"
   CTRL-X, y, ENTER to save the file

  Run these two commands
   omv-salt stage run prepare
   omv-salt deploy run nfs

Now back in a web browser, navigate to http://openmediavault
  Username: admin
  Password: openmediavault
  
Now, in the web browser, let's enable NFS:
  Services -> NFS
  Enable -> On
  Save
  Click Apply at the top of the screen, then Yes

Now would be a good time to check to ensure that NFSv2 was enabled properly
  Back in the OpenMediaVault terminal window, you can run the following command and check for "+2" in the output:
    Command:
      cat /proc/fs/nfsd/versions
    Expected Output (+2 means NFSv2 enabled, -2 means NFSv2 not enabled): 
      +2 +3 +4 +4.1 +4.2

Now, back in the web browser, let's set up our file system and shares:
  Storage -> File Systems
  Create
  Device: VBOX HARDDISK [/dev/sdb]
  Ok
  Yes
  When it says "the filesystem has completed successfully", click "Yes"

  Storage -> File Systems
  Click on /dev/sdb1
  Click Mount
  Click Apply at the top of the screen, then Yes

  Services -> NFS
  Click the "Shares" tab
  Click "+Add"
  Shared Folder: Click the Plus
  Name: test
  Device: /dev/sdb1
  path: test/
  Permissions: Everyone: read/write
  Save
  Client: *
  Privilege: Read/Write
  Extra options: all_squash,insecure,async,no_subtree_check,anonuid=0,anongid=0
  Save
  Click Apply at the top of the screen, then Yes

That's it!  The server is set up
