Configuring XFS
------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: This procedure will not work on 8088 systems (a NEC V20 or higher is required)

Obtain the XFS 1.91 DOS client: 
http://omolini.steptail.com/mirror/winsite/winsite-mar96-3/info/pc/win3/winsock/xfs191.zip/index.html

Unzip the above contents to a directory called xfs
Copy it to your retro PC

Locate a packet driver for your network card
Copy the packet driver to the xfs directory

In the xfs directory, modify the "hosts" file
 * Set the gateway, broadcast and netmask addresses to those of your network
 * Add an IP address and alias for the Raspberry Pi server
 * Add an IP address and alias for your client computer (just pick a new address on your network)
 
 Example Config file:
  
 192.168.1.1     gateway
 192.168.1.255   broadcast
 255.255.255.0   netmask
 
 192.168.1.140   nfspi
 192.168.1.111   client

In the xfs directory, modify the "init" file
  * modify the init line to initialize the client using the netmask and gateway from above, i.e.
      init client sm=255.255.255.0 gw=192.168.1.1 csum=off
  * modify the "pcnfsd line" to specify the pcnfsd server, which will be the "server" that you placed in the "hosts" file, i.e. 
      pcnfsd nfspi
  * remove the "login" line
  * modify the drive letter "mount" lines to mount a share, specifying a drive letter, the "server" name, 
    and the full path on the server of the share, i.e. 
      mount E: nfspi:/mnt/nfsshare
    (NOTE: if you want to user a drive letter that is further in the alphabet, add LASTDRIVE=Z to your config.sys)
  * modify the printer "mount" lines (i.e. lpt2) to map a printer, using the printer name as specified on the "server", i.e.
      mount lpt2 nfspi:test
  * and if you did the extra credit assignment and want to add your own laser printer, add a new mount line for that
      mount lpt3 nfspi:jetprint
  * comment out the rdate line
    
  Here's my complete init file:  
    init client sm=255.255.255.0 gw=192.168.1.1 csum=off
    pcnfsd nfspi
    mount E: nfspi:/mnt/nfsshare
    mount lpt2 nfspi:test
    mount lpt3 nfspi:jetprint
    show

In the xfs directory, modify xfs.bat
 * The first line should reference your packet driver, along with a command to initialize the packet vector to 0x60 (this command will vary by manufacturer)
 * The next line should be xfskrnl 0x60
 * And the last line should be xfstool @init (this references and executes the file you created in the previous step
 
 Here's my complete xfs.bat file
  pcntpk 0x60 INT=0x60
  xfskrnl 0x60
  xfstool @init

Using AMD PCNET III packet drivers with VirtualBox?
  * You can find packet drivers here: https://www.lazybrowndog.net/freedos/virtualbox/downloads/drivers/pcntpk.zip
  * Your first line of xfs.bat will look something like this: pcntpk INT=0x60

If you want to run on a newer system (i.e on a VM or a system > 200 Mhz), you need to patch C:\xfs\xfstool.exe
  Download and extract this utility
   https://www.kennedysoftware.ie/patchcrt.htm
  Run the utility
    patchcrt
    (press escape)
    C:\xfs\xfstool.exe
    Y to indicate you have a good backup
    (press escape)
  
Run and connect!
  cd xfs
  xfs.bat  
  
If you want to mount a new directory or printer, or execute a command to "show connections", you can do this from the command line, i.e.:
  * xfstool mount Q: nfspi:/some/other/path
  * xfstool umount lpt2
  * xfstool mount lpt2 nfspi:anotherprinter
  * xfstool show

If you want to make a new directory or printer permanent, add it to the C:\xfs\init file without the "xsftool" portion of the command 
  * See configuration performed in an above step for examples
