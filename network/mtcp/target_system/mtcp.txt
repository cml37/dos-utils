Add your packet driver to autoexec.bat (here's an example for the Xircom Pocket Ethernet III)
C:\xircom\pktdrv\pe3pd

Download mTCP from http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/ 
Unzip mtcp to a directory called "mtcp"

Create a file under mtcp called tcp.cfg with contents similar to these to match your network:
PACKETINT 0x60
IPADDR 192.168.1.100
NETMASK 255.255.255.0
GATEWAY 192.168.1.1
NAMESERVER 192.168.1.1
MTU 1500

Create a file under mtcp called config.bat:
set MTCPCFG=C:\mtcp\tcp.cfg

Create a file under mtcp called telnet.bat:
@echo off
call config.bat
telnet.exe raspberrypi

Create a file under mtcp called ftp.bat:
@echo off
call config.bat
ftp.exe raspberrypi
