-----------------------------------------------------
Getting Started
-----------------------------------------------------
Go to https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/ and download the amd64 version of the "netinst CD image"

Download and install Oracle VM VirtualBox (suggested version 6.0.18 or lower) https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.0.18/VirtualBox-6.0.18-136238-Win.exe
 * Newer versions of VirtualBox have removed supported for setting this feature to false: <HardwareVirtEx enabled="false"/> 
   * Not an issue for a DOS VM, but best to be safe

NetDrive Server Setup
-----------------------------------------------------
Create a Debian virtual machine in VirtualBox
New
Name: Debian
Memory size: 1024MB
Hard Disk: Create a virtual hard disk now
Hard disk file type: VMDK
Storage on physical hard disk: Dynamically allocated
File location and size: defaults are fine

Once created
 Settings
 Network
 Adapter 1
   Enable Network Adapter
   Attached to: Bridged Adapter
   Name: (Choose your network card)


-----------------------------------------------------
Launch Virtual Machine
-----------------------------------------------------
On launch choose the Debian Netinst ISO image

Install Debian
  * Choose Graphical Install
  * Choose Language, and Continue
  * Choose Location, and Continue
  * Choose Keyboard Layout, and Continue
  * For hostname, type netdrive, and Continue
  * For domain, leave blank, and Continue
  * Choose a root password (root is the "super user"), type it and confirm it, and Continue
  * Create a user name, call it "user", and Continue
  * Continue on next screen, the account will be called "user"
  * Choose a password for user, type it and confirm it, and Continue
  * Choose your time zone, and Continue
  * Choose "guided - use entire disk", and Continue
  * On partition screen, choose Continue
  * Choose "all files in one partition", and Continue
  * Choose "Finish partitioning and write changes to disk", and Continue
  * Choose "yes", and Continue
  * For scanning more media, choose "No", and Continue
  * For Package Manager, choose the country closest to you, and Continue
  * Choose the first mirror on the list, and Continue
  * For HTTP proxy, leave blank, and Continue
  * For the "popularity contest", choose No and Continue
  * For Software selection, I suggest unchecking Debian Desktop Environment and Gnome, then check SSH Server, and Continue
    * This procedure is going to rely on just using the command line shell... if you prefer graphical, you can leave Debian Desktop Environment and Gnome checked
  * For installing the GRUB boot loader, choose Yes and Continue
  * For location, choose /dev/sda and continue
  * For installation complete, choose Continue!

At the console, log in as root
  * Use the password you created during setup

Install sudo and add the "user" user to the sudo group  
  apt-get install sudo
  adduser user sudo

At this point, you might be best off using your favorite SSH client, but you can also use the console that appears after reboot.
 * I prefer SSH clients since it is easier to copy and paste
 * You can ssh as user@netdrive and use the password you created during setup

Create a directory for sharing files
  sudo mkdir /data
  sudo chmod 777 /data

At this point you also have a decision to make
 * Keep in mind that NetDrive only allows writing to the image by one computer at a time, and this procedure chooses the server to be the "writer"
   * As such, we can write to the drive, but need to do so by accessing the image as a Windows share, which requires LAN Manager for DOS
   * If you want to use MS-DOS LAN Manager from a DOS PC, you need to build a compatible version of Samba (not easy, but not hard)
   * Otherwise, you can just install the Samba packages (easy)

   
------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing Samba Packages 
(do this if you don't plan to use MS-DOS LAN Manager)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Install packages
  sudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin
  sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev libnss-winbind tcl

Configure samba to allow anyone to access and modify files on the share
  sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

  add these lines at the bottom of the file:

    [data]
        path = /data
        read only = no
        guest ok = yes
        guest account = root

  CTRL+X, then y, then <ENTER> to save
        

------------------------------------------------------------------
Building Samba Instead of Installing It
(do this if you do plan to use MS-DOS LAN Manager)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: The below procedure was derived from these two sources:
 * https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Build_Samba_from_Source#Manually_Starting_and_Stopping_the_Samba_AD_DC_Service_2
 * https://doc.owncloud.com/server/next/admin_manual/installation/manual_installation/compile_samba.html

Change to the root user
  sudo su

Obtain the Samba source for the last version to support SMB1
  wget https://download.samba.org/pub/samba/stable/samba-4.15.13.tar.gz
  tar -zxf samba-4.15.13.tar.gz

Fix an issue in bootstrap.sh related to a library update in Debian
  cd samba-4.15.13/bootstrap/generated-dists/debian11
  nano bootstrap.sh
    change libtracker-sparql-2.0-dev to libtracker-sparql-3.0-dev
  
    CTRL+X, then y, then <ENTER> to save

Run bootstrap to download needed dependencies to build Samba
  ./bootstrap.sh

Configure Samba to be built!
  cd ../../../..
  cd samba-4.15.13
  ./configure \
	--prefix=/usr \
	--enable-fhs \
	--sysconfdir=/etc \
	--localstatedir=/var \
	--with-privatedir=/var/lib/samba/private \
	--with-smbpasswd-file=/etc/samba/smbpasswd \
	--with-piddir=/var/run/samba \
	--with-pammodulesdir=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security \
	--libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu \
	--with-modulesdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/samba \
	--datadir=/usr/share \
	--with-lockdir=/var/run/samba \
	--with-statedir=/var/lib/samba \
	--with-cachedir=/var/cache/samba \
	--with-socketpath=/var/run/ctdb/ctdbd.socket \
	--with-logdir=/var/log/ctdb \
	--systemd-install-services \
	--without-ad-dc

Build Samba!
  make -j 4

Once Samba finishes building, install it!
  make -j 4 install 

Configure Samba to support SMB1 and to support your share at /data
  nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
  Insert the lines below:

  [global]
  lanman auth=yes
  ntlm auth = yes
  server min protocol = LANMAN2
  workgroup = WORKGROUP
  server role = standalone server
  map to guest = bad user

  log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
  max log size = 1000
  dns proxy = no

  [data]
      path = /data
      read only = no
      guest ok = yes
      guest account = root

  CTRL+X, then y, then <ENTER> to save

Update the service start script to support our Samba installation
  nano /lib/systemd/system/smb.service 
  Replace entire file contents with those below:

  [Unit]
  Description=Samba SMB Daemon
  Documentation=man:smbd(8) man:samba(7) man:smb.conf(5)
  Wants=network-online.target
  After=network.target network-online.target nmb.service winbind.service

  [Service]
  Type=notify
  PIDFile=/run/samba/smbd.pid
  LimitNOFILE=16384
  EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/samba
  ExecStart=/usr/sbin/smbd --foreground --no-process-group $SMBDOPTIONS
  ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
  LimitCORE=infinity

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target

  CTRL+X, then y, then <ENTER> to save

Start up Samba and configure it to start on boot!
  systemctl daemon-reload
  service smb start
  service nmb start
  systemctl enable smb.service
  systemctl enable nmb.service


------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing NetDrive
------------------------------------------------------------------
Copy netdrive executable to netdrive server
  sudo su
  mkdir /netdrive
  cd /netdrive
  wget http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/download/mTCP_NetDrive_2024-01-21_Servers.zip
  apt-get install unzip
  unzip mTCP_NetDrive_2024-01-21_Servers.zip
  mv mTCP_NetDrive_2024-01-21_Servers/linux_x86/netdrive .
  rm mTCP_NetDrive_2024-01-21_Servers.zip
  rm -rf mTCP_NetDrive_2024-01-21_Servers 

Create a directory for storing NetDrive images
  mkdir /images
  chmod -R 777 /images

Create an image, let's make it 1GB
  cd /images
  /netdrive/netdrive create hd 1000 FAT16B hdd.img
  chmod 777 /images/hdd.img

Let's prepare to mount the image
  nano /etc/fstab
  Add this line to the bottom of the file:
  
  /images/hdd.img /data/mount vfat loop,rw,user,exec,umask=000 0 0

  CTRL + X, Y, <Enter> to save file

Now let's mount the image manually (it will auto mount on future boots)
  mount /data

Let's add netdrive server to startup
  apt-get install screen
  nano /etc/rc.local
  Add the following lines (be sure that there are no spaces at the beginning of the lines):

  #!/bin/sh -e
  screen -dm -S netdrive /netdrive/netdrive serve -image_dir /images
  exit 0

  CTRL + X, Y, <Enter> to save file

Let's make /etc/rc.local executable
  chmod 777 /etc/rc.local

Now let's reboot!
  reboot
  
After reboot, log back in, either via SSH, or via the console

Let's attach to netdrive to confirm it is running
  screen -r netdrive

If you get an error about "there is no screen to be resumed matching netdrive", then you made an error.  Retrace your steps above.
  To get out of the attached screen, you do a CTRL + a, then d
  Or if you want to watch the screen for the next series of steps, just leave it up!  It does print out good debug info
