==================================================
Introduction
==================================================
This procedure will take you through setting up a Mars NWE server on a Raspberry Pi,
as well as setting up an MS-DOS NetWare Client

In order for Mars NWE to work, it's necessary to use an "older kernel version" on the 
Raspberry Pi that supports IPX.

This procedure will demonstrate how to build and install an older Raspbian Linux kernel,
as well as how to build/install and configure Mars NWE


==================================================
Prerequisites
==================================================
You have set up a Raspberry Pi and enabled SSH.
  See my instructions here for an example: https://github.com/cml37/dos-utils/blob/master/config/my_raspberrypi_setup_instructions.txt
  Also, be sure to set up "Wait for network" at boot!

For the client, find and download the following:
  AMD PCNet network card client drivers (lan.zip): https://www.helpjet.net/Fs-80528992-89055134-94629108.html
  -- unzip to folder named lan
  AMD PCNet client32 drivers (client32.zip) (we will only need this for an updated version of lsl.com): https://www.helpjet.net/Fs-43321125-89055134-88652830.html
  -- unzip to folder named client32
  Xircom PE3 Drivers (pe3drv.exe) (we will only use this to get a copy of netx and ipxodi): https://www.helpjet.net/Fs-72579889-75843699-73056547-extract.html

Also, locate your licensed copy of MS-DOS 6.22 install disks


==================================================
Build Linux Kernel 4.14.X
==================================================
Before installing Mars NWE, we need to install a compatible kernel.
The last known kernel version to support IPX was 4.14.
As such, that's what we will be building here.  Here are the steps:

git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux.git --single-branch --branch rpi-4.14.y

cd linux

# Note - the below assumes Raspberry Pi Model 3B+.  
# For different models, your config options may be different
# (please see https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/kernel/building.md)
make bcm2709_defconfig

apt-get install libncurses-dev
make menuconfig

Networking Support <enter>
Networking Options <enter>
The IPX Protocol => M
IPX: Full internal IPX network => (unchecked)
Exit
Exit
Exit
Yes

make -j4 zImage modules dtbs
sudo make modules_install
sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/*.dtb /boot/
sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/*.dtb* /boot/overlays/
sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/README /boot/overlays/
sudo cp arch/arm/boot/zImage /boot/kernel7-ipx.img

vi /boot/config.txt
  kernel=kernel7-ipx.img


==================================================
Build Mars NWE from Source
==================================================
Install support libraries
  sudo apt-get install libgdbm-dev cmake

Download and build Mars NWE
  wget http://ftp.disconnected-by-peer.at/ncpfs/mars_nwe-0.99.pl23.tar.bz2
  bunzip2 mars_nwe-0.99.pl23.tar.bz2
  tar xf mars_nwe-0.99.pl23.tar
  cd mars_nwe-0.99.pl23
  cmake .
  make
  sudo make install

Configure Mars NWE
  sudo vi /usr/local/etc/mars_nwe/nwserv.conf

    Change section 1 to read like this (basically, change the umask)
          1       SYS             /var/mars_nwe/SYS/                kt   777 777
    Completely comment out section 3
          (comment out section 3)
    Change section 4 to read linke this, comment out any extra lines
          4   0x22    eth0    802.3 1
    Change section 8 to read linke this, comment out any extra lines
          7    8
    Change section 9 to read linke this, comment out any extra lines
          9    0777    0777 
    If you want extra debugging on the netware server (nwserv), change this line in section 101
          101    99               # debug NWSERV

Some commentary on configuration
  Although Novell uses 802.2 for NetWare 3.12, I found, at least when running as a virtual machine, that file copies, etc. are
  unreliable and time out, and as such, switched to 802.3, which seems to have cleared up the problem

Add these lines to /etc/rc.local above the exit 0 line to support startup of Mars NWE on system reboot
  mkdir -p /var/log/mars_nwe
  mkdir -p /var/run/mars_nwe
  nwserv

At this point, reboot the Rasbperry Pi

Troubleshooting
  Have a look at routes here, if more than two routes, there may be issues
   sudo cat /proc/net/ipx/route

  Killing nwserv and associated processes (there may be a better way)
   sudo pkill -9 ncpserv
   sudo pkill -9 nwserv
   sudo pkill -9 nwbind
   sudo pkill -9 nwconn
   
   
==================================================
Setting up a NetWare DOS Client
==================================================
Create a new VirtualBox VM
  New
  Name: Novell Client
  Type: Other
  Version: DOS
  Memory size: 16MB
  Hard Disk: Create a virtual hard disk now
  Hard disk file type: VMDK (this is important so that WinImage can open your hard disk file!!)
  Storage on physical hard disk: Dynamically allocated
  File location and size: defaults are fine

Once created
 Settings
 Network
 Adapter 1
   Enable Network Adapter
   Attached to: Bridged Adapter
   Name: <choose your network card adapter>

Insert the MS-DOS 6.22 install disk 1 into the disk drive
  Select Virtual Machien
  Click Settings
  Storage
  Add disk 1 as a floppy
  Ok
  
Start the virtual machine

MS-DOS 6.22 Setup
 Enter
 Configure Unallocated Disk Space
 Enter
 Enter to restart
 Enter to select "The settings are correct"
 Enter to select C:\DOS
 Insert Disks as prompted and press enter
 When requested, remove the floppy disk and press enter
 Press Enter to restart
 
Power down the Novell Client virtual machine

At this point, it's time to inject some files into the image
Using WinImage
  -- Open the vmdk file (C:\users\<your user name\VirtualBox VMS\Novell Client.vmdk)
  -- From lan\netware\dos, inject pcntnw.com into a directory named net
    -- Click on \ folder
    -- Image | Create Folder | net
    -- Click on net
    -- Image | Inject | pcntnw.com | Yes
  -- from client32, inject lsl.com into a directory named net
    -- Click on net
    -- Image | Inject | lsl.com | Yes
  -- inject pe3drv.exe into a directory named pe3drv
    -- Click on \ folder
    -- Image | Create Folder | pe3drv
    -- Click on pe3drv
    -- Image | Inject | pe3drv.exe | Yes
    
Close WinImage

Start up the Netware Client

Set up ipxodi and netx drivers
  cd \pe3drv
  pe3drv
  keep pressing "y" until extraction is done
  copy odi\ipxodi.com C:\net
  copy odi\netx.exe C:\net
  
Configure the Netware Client
  cd \
  dos\edit autoexec.bat
  add the following lines to the bottom of the file:
    PATH=C:\net;%PATH%
    lsl
    pcntnw
    ipxodi
    netx
    F:
  Save and exit
  
  dos\edit C:\net\net.cfg
  add the following lines:
    Link Driver PCNTNW
      Frame ETHERNET_802.3
  Save and exit

Reboot the virtual machine

From there you should be able to change to drive F: and login as supervisor!!
  F:
  login supervisor
  password: top-secret (or another password if you happened to change it in the config file)

What's next?  It's up to you:
  Clone the virtual machine to have multiple clients?
  Install some network shareable programs (WordPerfect 5.1?  Something else?)
  Call it a day?
