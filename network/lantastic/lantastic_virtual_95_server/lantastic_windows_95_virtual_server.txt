Video walkthrough of the below procedure is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyo3LSeMgDI

====================================
Prerequisites
====================================
You must have a PC with a wired network card.  Wireless cards will not work in bridge networking mode, which is required for this procedure.

====================================
Items to Locate
====================================
Oracle VM VirtualBox (suggested version 6.0.18 or lower) https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.0.18/VirtualBox-6.0.18-136238-Win.exe
 * Newer versions of VirtualBox have removed supported for setting this feature to false: <HardwareVirtEx enabled="false"/> 
   * Not an issue for a Windows 95 VM, but is an issue for a Windows 3.1 VM   
WinImage: http://www.winimage.com/download.htm
Fix95CPU: http://lonecrusader.x10host.com/fix95cpu.html
  * Required for VirtualBox > 6.0.18
  * Optional for VirtualBox <= 6.0.18
    * You can just hand edit your vbox file and add <HardwareVirtEx enabled="false"/> to the <CPU> Section
      * However, on next "update" of your machine configuration, VirtualBox 6.0.18 will "remove" this setting
        * Most likely, this is true on earlier versions as well
      * As such, using this utility is the "easy button"
  
Bootable ISO Image for DOS 6.22: https://www.allbootdisks.com/disk_images/DOS6.22_bootdisk.iso

Installations
====================================
Install Oracle VM VirtualBox
Install WinImage

====================================
Create and Configure Virtual Machine
====================================
Create a Windows 95 virtual machine in VirtualBox
New
Name: Windows 95
Memory size: 64MB
Hard Disk: Create a virtual hard disk now
Hard disk file type: VMDK (this is important so that WinImage can open your hard disk file!!)
Storage on physical hard disk: Dynamically allocated
File location and size: defaults are fine

Once created
 Settings
 Network
 Adapter 1
   Enable Network Adapter
   Attached to: Bridged Adapter
   Name: (choose your wired network adapter... wireless will NOT work)

(Optional) If you don't want to use Fix95CPU
  Locate the vbox file for your virtual machine and add this line under the <CPU> section:
    <HardwareVirtEx enabled="false"/> 
  Please note: any further updates to the VirtualBox VM GUI will overwrite this setting!!

====================================
Launch Virtual Machine
====================================
Insert bootable DOS 6.22 ISO into the virtual CD ROM drive

After system boots:
  Perform FDISK
    Choose "1" to create DOS partition
    Choose "1" to create primary partition

  Insert Fix95CPU into the virtual CD ROM drive
  On first reboot, follow steps to install Fix95CPU
  Remove Fix95CPU from the virtual CD ROM drive
