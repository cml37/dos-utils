 * Newer versions of VirtualBox have removed supported for setting this feature to false: <HardwareVirtEx enabled="false"/> 
   * Not an issue for a DOS VM, but best to be safe

====================================
Installations
====================================
Install Oracle VM VirtualBox
Install WinImage

====================================
Create and Configure Virtual Machine
====================================
Create a DOS virtual machine in VirtualBox
New
Name: LANtastic Client
Memory size: 32MB
Hard Disk: Create a virtual hard disk now
Hard disk file type: VMDK (this is important so that WinImage can open your hard disk file!!)
Storage on physical hard disk: Dynamically allocated
File location and size: defaults are fine

Once created
 Settings
 Network
 Adapter 1
   Enable Network Adapter
   Attached to: Bridged Adapter
   Name: (choose to match the LANtastic server.  You CAN use wireless for virtualized hardware, but NOT for real hardware)

====================================
Launch Virtual Machine
====================================
Insert bootable DOS 6.22 ISO into the virtual CD ROM drive

After system boots:
  Perform FDISK
    Choose "1" to create DOS partition
    Choose "1" to create primary partition
    Choose "Y" to choose maximum space
  Reboot
  Format C: /s
  Remove bootable ISO from the virtual CD ROM drive
  Shut down virtual machine

Create a text file called protocol.ini with the following contents:

;PROTOCOL.INI for LANtastic Version 6.00
;--- using AMD PCNET III Fast Ethernet Adapter

[PROTMAN]
   DRIVERNAME = PROTMAN$
   DYNAMIC = YES

[PCNTND_NIF]
   DRIVERNAME = PCNTND$


Create a floppy disk image with NDIS drivers using WinImage
  -- File | New | 1.44 MB | Ok
  -- From pcntnd, inject the AMD PCNET NDIS Driver
    -- Click on \ 
    -- Image | Inject | pcntnd.dos | Yes
  -- Inject the protocol.ini file you just created above
    -- Click on \ 
    -- Image | Inject | protocol.ini | Yes
  -- File | Save As
    -- Type: Image file (*.ima)
    -- File Name: pcntnd.ima
    -- Save
 
 
 
====================================
Install LANTastic
====================================
Start the virtual machine

Insert LANtastic 6.0 Disk 1 into the virtual floppy drive
 A:
 install
 enter
 press any key
 press any key
 Computer name: DOSTASTIC
 enter to choose drive C: 
 enter to choose \LANTASTI directory
 Your choice regarding sharing printer and drivers (sharing will take more memory though!)
 enter for optional features (leave them all unselected)
 enter to continue with installation
 select NDIS support for Network Adapters
 (put pcntnd.ima into the floppy drive and press enter)
 insert LANtastic disk 1 into the drive and press enter
 select "Do not set up any drive or printer connections" and press enter
 Ok to perform the installation => enter
 press any key
 insert disk 2 when prompted
 any key to acknowlege autoexec.bat
 any key to acknowlege config.sys
 any key to continue
 remove disk and reboot
 
 
====================================
Connect Up drives and printers
====================================
After the VM client reboots, and assuming the server is running, wait a minute or so for the server to be discovered, then proceed

Here's an example on how you can connect to a drive!
  net
  Connect to Other Computers' Drives
  D:
  (LANTASTIC)
  Enter when prompted about time
  C-DRIVE
  
Here's an example on how you can connect to a printer!
  net
  Connect to Other Computers' Printers
  LPT1
  \\LANTASTIC
  @PRINT-1
  
Press esc to exit the net program
  
Now if you exit the net program and want to save your connections for future reboots, you can do something like this
  net show/batch > C:\lantasti\connect.bat

If you want to login without a password prompt, edit C:\lantasti\connect.bat and change the net user line to something like this
  net user dostastic ""
